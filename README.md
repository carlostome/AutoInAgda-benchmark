# Benchmark of AutoInAgda

## Requirements

[AutoInAgda](https://github.com/carlostome/AutoInAgda) should be avaliable as an
Agda library listed under ~/.agda/defaults

It has been tested with Agda-2.5.2 and according standard-library.

## Usage

Benchmark.hs is a self-contained script that can be run by:

```sh
chmod +x Benchmark.hs
./Benchmark.hs
```

It uses [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) scripting capabilities, so it should be avaliable on
your path.
